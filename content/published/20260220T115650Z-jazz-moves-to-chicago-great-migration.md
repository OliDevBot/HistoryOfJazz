# When Jazz Moved to Chicago: The Great Migration and the Birth of a New Sound

By 1917, the music born in New Orleans was ready to travel. The U.S. Navy had shuttered Storyville, Jim Crow was tightening its grip on the South, and a vast movement of African Americans — the Great Migration — was pulling hundreds of thousands of people northward toward industrial jobs, better wages, and the promise of dignity. Chicago, connected to New Orleans by the Illinois Central Railroad, became the most important destination. And the musicians came too.

This is the story of how jazz left its birthplace and reinvented itself on Chicago's South Side — how collective improvisation gave way to the age of the soloist, how a mentor named King Oliver summoned a young Louis Armstrong north, and how the recordings made in Chicago during the 1920s changed popular music forever.

## The Pull of the South Side

The Great Migration was not primarily a musical event — it was an exodus driven by racial violence, economic exploitation, and the desire for basic freedom. But music traveled with the people. As the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Isabel Wilkerson has noted, at one point ten thousand Black Americans were arriving in Chicago every month [1].

Chicago's South Side became a self-sustaining Black metropolis. The Stroll — a stretch of South State Street between 26th and 39th — filled with dance halls, cabarets, theaters, and restaurants. The Dreamland Cafe, the Pekin Inn, the Plantation Cafe, and later the Sunset Cafe became stages where New Orleans musicians could play nightly for enthusiastic audiences who had money to spend. Unlike New Orleans, where racial hierarchies constrained performance opportunities, Chicago offered Black musicians a commercial ecosystem: steady gigs, recording studios, and an audience hungry for the new "hot" music [1][3].

## King Oliver Plants the Flag

Joseph "King" Oliver was the man who established New Orleans jazz in Chicago. A big, quiet cornetist known for his "talking horn" — he used mutes, cups, and plungers to make his instrument converse without words — Oliver had been one of the top bandleaders in New Orleans, running with Kid Ory's band and later leading his own groups [1].

Oliver left New Orleans around 1918, tired of run-ins with police and the limitations of the Southern social order. He settled on the South Side and by 1922 had assembled King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, featuring some of the finest New Orleans musicians who had followed the railroad north: clarinetist Johnny Dodds, his brother Baby Dodds on drums, trombonist Honoré Dutrey, pianist Lil Hardin, and bassist Bill Johnson [1][3].

The Creole Jazz Band played at the Lincoln Gardens (originally the Royal Gardens), a large dance hall at 459 East 31st Street. Their sound was the New Orleans collective style at its peak: all the horns weaving simultaneous melodic lines, the rhythm section driving a steady, danceable pulse. But Oliver added something new — pre-arranged two-cornet breaks, intricate duets that sounded improvised but were actually rehearsed. These breaks required a second cornetist who could match Oliver note for note.

## Armstrong Arrives

In the summer of 1922, Oliver sent a telegram to New Orleans summoning his young protégé, Louis Armstrong. Armstrong, then twenty-one years old, boarded the Illinois Central and arrived at Chicago's Illinois Central Station. Years later, he described the journey as one of the pivotal moments of his life [1][2].

Armstrong joined the Creole Jazz Band as second cornet, and the two-cornet breaks became the band's signature. Audiences were astonished: the two horns seemed to read each other's minds, executing perfectly harmonized passages in the middle of otherwise collectively improvised performances. The Creole Jazz Band recorded for Gennett, Okeh, Paramount, and Columbia in 1923, producing some of the most important early jazz recordings — "Dippermouth Blues," "Canal Street Blues," "Chimes Blues" — that documented the New Orleans collective style at its most polished [3].

But Armstrong was already outgrowing the collective format. His tone was bigger, his rhythmic sense more adventurous, and his melodic imagination more daring than anything the ensemble style could contain. Lil Hardin, who married Armstrong in 1924, encouraged him to step out on his own. He left Oliver's band and briefly joined Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in New York before returning to Chicago.

## The Hot Five and Hot Seven: Jazz Finds the Soloist

Back in Chicago, Armstrong formed his studio recording groups — Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five (1925–1927) and His Hot Seven (1927–1928) — and made a series of recordings for Okeh Records that fundamentally redefined jazz. These were not working bands that played live gigs; they existed primarily in the recording studio, which freed Armstrong to experiment [2][3].

The Hot Five and Hot Seven recordings represent the moment jazz pivoted from collective improvisation to the solo as the music's central event. On tracks like "Cornet Chop Suey" (1926), "Potato Head Blues" (1927), and above all "West End Blues" (1928), Armstrong demonstrated a level of technical virtuosity, rhythmic sophistication, and emotional depth that no jazz musician had previously captured on record. His opening cadenza on "West End Blues" — a cascade of notes that climbs, pauses, and plunges in twelve astonishing seconds — is often cited as the single most influential moment in recorded jazz history [3].

Armstrong also pioneered scat singing during this period — improvising with nonsense syllables, using his voice as another instrument. "Heebie Jeebies" (1926) is often credited as the first recorded example, though Armstrong later said he had been scatting for years [2].

The impact was seismic. After the Hot Five and Hot Seven sessions, jazz was no longer primarily an ensemble music of collective conversation. It was increasingly a music of individual expression, anchored by the solo improviser. Every major jazz movement that followed — swing, bebop, cool, free jazz — built on this shift.

## Chicago Style: White Kids Listen In

The New Orleans musicians on the South Side didn't play in a vacuum. Their audiences included young white musicians who were electrified by what they heard. A group of teenagers from Austin High School on the city's far west side — Jimmy McPartland on cornet, Bud Freeman on saxophone, Frank Teschemacher on clarinet, Jim Lanigan on bass, and others — discovered jazz through phonograph records at a local ice cream parlor [2].

"I believe the first tune we played was 'Farewell Blues.' Boy, when we heard that — I'll tell you we went out of our mind," McPartland recalled. "We stayed there from about three in the afternoon until eight at night, just listening to those records one after another, over and over again" [2].

The Austin High Gang, as they became known, couldn't read music at first. They learned by imitating records and sneaking into South Side clubs where they were too young to legally enter. They absorbed the New Orleans collective style but played it faster, with a more aggressive rhythmic attack and a nervous, driving energy that reflected their urban environment. Along with musicians like Bix Beiderbecke, Eddie Condon, and Gene Krupa, they helped create what came to be called "Chicago style" jazz — a bridge between the New Orleans tradition and the emerging swing era [2].

## The Recording Studios

Chicago in the 1920s was one of the recording capitals of the United States. Labels like Okeh, Paramount, Gennett, Brunswick, and Columbia maintained studios or sent mobile recording units to the city. This infrastructure was crucial: it meant that the music being developed on the South Side could be captured, distributed, and heard nationally [3].

The "race records" market — recordings marketed specifically to Black audiences — boomed during the decade. Musicians who might have been heard by hundreds in a single club could now reach tens of thousands through 78 rpm discs. King Oliver, Louis Armstrong, Jelly Roll Morton (who recorded his Red Hot Peppers sessions in Chicago in 1926–1928), Johnny Dodds, and Jimmie Noone all made landmark recordings in the city during this period [3].

These records didn't just document the music — they shaped it. Musicians could now study each other's innovations by replaying a record over and over, exactly as the Austin High Gang had done. The feedback loop between live performance and recorded artifact accelerated the evolution of jazz in ways that would have been impossible in the oral-tradition world of pre-recording New Orleans.

## The End of the Chicago Moment

By the late 1920s, the center of gravity was shifting again. The Great Depression devastated the entertainment industry, closing clubs and reducing recording budgets. Many musicians moved to New York, which was becoming the new capital of jazz, driven by Harlem's vibrant nightlife, the rise of big bands, and the commercial power of Broadway and radio networks.

Armstrong himself left Chicago for New York in 1929 and never returned as a permanent resident. But the decade he spent in Chicago — and the recordings he made there — had permanently altered the course of the music. Jazz had arrived in New Orleans as a collective, street-level art form. It left Chicago as a modern, recorded, soloist-driven music with a national audience and a growing international reputation.

## Why It Matters

The Chicago chapter of jazz history illustrates something essential about how culture moves. Jazz didn't simply relocate from New Orleans to Chicago — it transformed in transit. The Great Migration carried people, and those people carried music, and that music changed when it encountered new audiences, new technologies, and new economic realities.

King Oliver brought the New Orleans collective style to the South Side. Armstrong blew it open and created the jazz solo as a vehicle for individual expression. The Austin High Gang absorbed it and reflected it back through a different social lens. And the recording studios captured all of it, creating a permanent archive that would teach and inspire musicians for a century to come.

The story of jazz in 1920s Chicago is, at its heart, a story about what happens when a displaced community builds something new — and how the music they make becomes a mirror for the freedom they sought.
