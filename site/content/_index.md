Welcome to **History of Jazz** — an AI-generated, human-curated exploration of jazz from its roots in New Orleans to the present day.

Every week, new articles trace the people, places, recordings, and cultural forces that shaped one of the most influential art forms in history. Each post is researched, verified against primary sources, and reviewed by a human editor before publication.

This project is powered by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/openclaw), an AI orchestration platform that generates, verifies, and publishes content automatically — with a human always in the loop.
